# Orthros CLI
Command line interface for the Orthros Messenger

This code is probably very buggy, and quite an abuse of nodejs in my opinion, but it seems to work just fine.


## Usage

```bash
Orthros Messenger v1.0.0
Command line options;
./orthros send [Recieving UUID] "[Message]" - Sends supplied message to UUID, put message in quotes.
./orthros check - Checks for messages in queue
./orthros read [Message ID] - Decrypts and reads message for ID
./orthros delete [Message ID] - Deletes a message given it's ID
```
